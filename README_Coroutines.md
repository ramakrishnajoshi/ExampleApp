## Coroutines vs Threads

### Key Differences

| Feature | Coroutines | Threads |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Memory Usage | Lightweight (few dozen bytes) | Heavyweight (~1MB stack space) |
| Quantity | Can create thousands or millions | Limited by system resources |
| Scheduling | Cooperative | Preemptive |
| Blocking | Suspends without blocking thread | Blocks entire thread |
| Context Switching | Cheap, handled by Kotlin runtime | Expensive, handled by OS |
| Programming Model | Sequential for async code | Often requires callbacks |

### Advantages of Coroutines

1. **Resource Efficiency**: Coroutines consume significantly less memory than threads
2. **Scalability**: Can create many more coroutines than threads
3. **Simplified Concurrency**: Write asynchronous code in a sequential manner
4. **Structured Concurrency**: Parent-child relationships for better control
5. **Built-in Cancellation**: Easy cancellation propagation through hierarchy

## Internal Working of Coroutines

### Suspension Points

Coroutines can suspend execution at specific points (marked with `suspend` functions) without blocking the thread. When a coroutine suspends:

1. Its current state is saved (local variables, call stack)
2. The thread is released to run other coroutines
3. When ready to resume, the coroutine continues from where it left off

### Continuation-Passing Style

Behind the scenes, the Kotlin compiler transforms suspending functions into a state machine:

1. Each suspension point becomes a state in this machine
2. When a coroutine suspends, a continuation object is created containing:
   - Current state of the coroutine
   - Data needed to resume execution
   - Reference to the next code to execute

### Coroutine Context

Every coroutine has a context that includes:

1. **Job**: Controls the coroutine's lifecycle
2. **Dispatcher**: Determines which thread(s) the coroutine runs on
3. **CoroutineExceptionHandler**: Handles uncaught exceptions
4. **CoroutineName**: Optional name for debugging

## Cooperative vs Preemptive Scheduling

### Cooperative Scheduling (Coroutines)

In cooperative scheduling:

1. **Voluntary Yielding**: 
   - Each coroutine decides when to yield control
   - Suspension only happens at specific suspension points
   - A coroutine cannot be interrupted in the middle of computation

2. **Predictable Switching**:
   - Developers know exactly where coroutines may switch context
   - Makes reasoning about shared state easier
   - Less need for synchronization mechanisms

3. **Efficiency**:
   - No need for context switching at arbitrary points
   - Lower overhead as the runtime doesn't need to constantly check if it should switch

4. **Potential Issue**:
   - If a coroutine performs CPU-intensive work without suspension points, it can hog the thread
   - Other coroutines won't get a chance to run until the current one yields

### Preemptive Scheduling (Threads)

In preemptive scheduling:

1. **Forced Interruption**:
   - The operating system can interrupt a thread at any time
   - Threads don't need to explicitly yield control

2. **Time Slicing**:
   - Each thread gets a small time slice to execute
   - When the time slice expires, the OS forces a context switch

3. **Fairness**:
   - Ensures all threads get execution time
   - Prevents any single thread from monopolizing the CPU

4. **Complexity**:
   - Requires careful synchronization for shared resources
   - Race conditions are more common
   - Context switching is more expensive

## API Call Examples

### Coroutine Implementation

```kotlin
// Using coroutines for concurrent API calls
suspend fun performApiCalls() = coroutineScope {
    val startTime = System.currentTimeMillis()
    
    // Launch both API calls concurrently
    val firstDeferred = async { firstApiCall() } // Takes 10 seconds
    val secondDeferred = async { secondApiCall(fastResponse = false) } // Takes 5 or 15 seconds
    
    // Wait for both results
    val firstResult = firstDeferred.await()
    val secondResult = secondDeferred.await()
    
    val totalTime = (System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime) / 1000
    println("Total time: $totalTime seconds") // ~15 seconds if fastResponse = false
}

// Suspending functions that don't block threads
suspend fun firstApiCall(): String {
    delay(10000) // Suspends coroutine without blocking thread
    return "Data from first API"
}

suspend fun secondApiCall(fastResponse: Boolean): String {
    delay(if (fastResponse) 5000 else 15000)
    return "Data from second API"
}
